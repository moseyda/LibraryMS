The json files in this directory contain sample data exported from a MongoDB database.
Each file corresponds to a specific collection within the database and is formatted in JSON for easy readability and manipulation.

To use these files, you can import them into your own MongoDB instance using the MongoDB Compass GUI.

To import a JSON file using MongoDB Compass, follow these steps:

1. Open MongoDB Compass and connect
2. Hover over localhost:27017 and click "+"
3. Name the database strictly as following (dbLibraryMS) and collection names as per the file names (e.g., "Books", "BorrowReturnHist", etc.)
4. After creating the database and collection, click on the collection name to open it.
5. Click on the "ADD DATA" button.
6. Select "Import File" from the dropdown menu.
7. In the import dialog, click "SELECT FILE" and choose the corresponding JSON file from this directory.
8. Ensure the "File Type" is set to "JSON".
9. Click the "IMPORT" button to start the import process.
10. Repeat the above steps for each JSON file in this directory to populate all collections in the database.

Once all files are imported, you will have a fully populated MongoDB database ready for use.

** Note: It's mandatory for this project to create the database with the name "dbLibraryMS" and one collection;
** At least the "Admin" collection should be created as the credentials for the admin is predefined in the application code.
--> Failure to do so may result in authentication issues when accessing the admin interface.
** Other collection names should match the file names for consistency and to avoid confusion.
For safety and avoid potential errors, please import all collections as provided. in this directory.
